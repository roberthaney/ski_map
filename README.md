# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Neighborhood Map Project: Rob Haney

## Basic information
This site was designed to take advantage of AJAX and the knockout.js framework to produce a single-page application with a dynamic user interface.
This site was also structured with bootstrap for responsive design, and integrates the jQuery library.
Mulitple third-party APIs are linked to produce a useful functionality.

## Usage
This page displays ski areas for a local region on a google map.  
The map has markers that upon interaction, retrieve up-to-date third-party data on the ski area of choice.  
This data includes information from wikipedia and current weather conditions.  
An interactive list view replicates the marker functionality.  
The list and viewable markers can be searched using a text input field to focus on specific ski areas.
